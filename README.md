This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone repo

git clone https://github.com/vikalsingh/smsParseTask.git

- npm install
- pod install

And run in terminal (Android/iOS)

Note:

1. I added chart library but its not working on Android, than i added this in iOS and worked. So you can see charts only in iOS simulator.

2. For SMS parse: I added library for this but it will not work on iOS. It will work on Android, i added hooks to parse the SMS.
